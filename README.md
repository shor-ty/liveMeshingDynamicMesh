# Description
This is a community driven mesh library that handles arbitrary mesh motion. The mesh motion is propagated into the internal mesh until the mesh quality is too bad. After that, the old mesh and its data is used to directly remesh the geometry and map the old data to the new mesh. IO-Less activity - everything is handled inside the memory.
